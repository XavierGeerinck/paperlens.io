# Introduction

Silicon is reaching its physical limits. What if we could use nature's most efficient energy harvester—photosynthesis—to perform logic operations?

## The Chloroplast Gate

By modifying the electron transport chain in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, we can create a state where the presence of specific wavelengths acts as a logical AND gate.

> "Nature has had billions of years to optimize energy transfer. We are just tapping into the API."

## Experimental Setup

1. **Input A**: 450nm Light Source (Blue)
2. **Input B**: 660nm Light Source (Red)
3. **Output**: Fluorescence measurement at 700nm

## Future Work

Scaling this to a biological CPU requires maintaining homeostasis in a closed loop system.
