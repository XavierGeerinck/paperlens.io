# The Water Crisis

Access to clean water is the defining challenge of our century. Traditional desalination is energy-intensive.

## Metamaterial Lattice

We propose a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) specifically structured to trap humidity at night (adsorption) and release it as liquid water when heated by sunlight during the day (desorption).

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Efficiency**: 1.2 kg water / kg material / day
- **Energy Cost**: 0 kWh
- **Lifespan**: 10+ years
